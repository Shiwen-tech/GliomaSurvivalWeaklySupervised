# Glioblastoma Semi-Supervised Survival - Simulated

This project simulates small MRI volumes with synthetic tumors to explore semi-supervised learning and survival modeling in glioblastoma.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Simulated MRI volumes and labels
- **scripts/**: Data generation and modeling scripts
- **results/**: Segmentation outputs and survival plots

## Goals
- Explore semi-supervised segmentation with weak labels
- Evaluate survival modeling robustness


# Glioblastoma Semi-Supervised Survival - BraTS

This project uses real MRI data from the BraTS 2020 dataset to develop semi-supervised segmentation models and survival analysis pipelines.

## Project Structure
- **data/BraTS2020/**: MRI volumes and segmentation labels
- **scripts/**: Preprocessing, training, and analysis scripts
- **results/**: Segmentation and survival analysis outputs

## Goals
- Build a semi-supervised segmentation pipeline
- Perform radiomics-based survival analysis
